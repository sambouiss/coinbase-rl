# coinbase-rl
A reinforcement learning framework for market making on Coinbase. The framework is something I came up with to turn the market information into an RL enviroment.

The Agent is implemented using D3PG and SWA. 

Currently WIP to do:
  - add tests for classes 
  - clean up code 
  - create args for running 
  - add config files for parameters for model

# Usage
To setup project run
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
